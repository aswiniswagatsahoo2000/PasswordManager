# PasswordManager
The Password Manager project is a simple web application that allows users to store and manage their passwords for various websites securely. The application is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and does not rely on any external backend server. It stores the user's password data locally on their system using the browser's local storage.


# Features:
•	Users can input their website name, username, and password information and save it using the submit button.
•	Then save passwords are displayed in a tabular form and after saving the password you can delete the password also. Passwords are stored locally using the browser's local storage.
•	If you want to copy the website name, username, and password to paste anywhere you can.


# Local Storage Implementation:
The project utilizes JavaScript to interact with the browser's local storage API. When a user saves a password, the data is stored in the local storage as a JSON object. This allows the application to retrieve and display the stored passwords each time the user opens the application.

# Add and manage passwords:
Users can use the provided form to add, view, and manage their passwords.
